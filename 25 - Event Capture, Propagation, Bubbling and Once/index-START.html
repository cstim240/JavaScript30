<!--During the capturing phase, the event propagates from the topmost element to the target element.
In the target phase, the event is handled by the target element itself.
During the bubbling phase, the event propagates from the target element to the topmost element.
By understanding these phases, you can control how events are handled and choose whether to capture them during the capturing phase or let them bubble up during the bubbling phase.-->
